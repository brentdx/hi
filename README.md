# Hi

I'm Brent. I like empowering people with tools to grow their businesses and have fun. I'm a proud new dad. When I was 8 one of my paintings traveled the world with Sotheby's, and in high school I won a screenwriting award. It's all been downhill from there.

**Some things I've done**
- Please make yourself at home. This GH Repo hosts the outputs of some of my work.

**Some things I believe:**
- It's easier to try to raise the ceiling and build for 100 people than raise the floor and try to build for 1m people. But raising the floor is more a legacy play.
- It's much easier to work on things that are exciting to you.
- One week is 2% of the year so work with speed but don't hurry.
- Be aware of how lossy your communication is. Compression is sometimes an asset, but usually a liability.
- We are often not even asking the right questions.
- The goal is not to avoid mistakes; the goal is to achieve uncorrelated levels of excellence in some dimension.

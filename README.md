Brent Davis' Portfolio
In a world of mindless emails, slacks, and DMs, the written word is often undervalued. I contend that writing with passion, intention, and efficiency (PIE) is critical to motivating and aligning action - and that's why I felt it important to include a README highlighting... me.

Name: Brent Davis
Role: Building products and teams that create trust and drive liquidity
Bio: Hello! I'm Brent. I'm a 3x founder (1 exit, 2 oopsies), first 15 business hire at Snap, and led product at Wave.tv ($25m ARR). I love problems for which there is no map other than the customer constellations.

Betwise (Oopsy #2)
After hundreds of (cold call, cold DM) conversations across the sports betting world, it was clear to me the economic landscape was changing fast: sportsbooks' acquisition costs (CACs) were rising as the risk-seeking bettor market reaches its limit, which means sports creators who drove much of that growth are making less in affiliate fees. Meanwhile, the entire betting data industry had been so focused on AI black boxes that they made customer relationships transactional without any experiential component.

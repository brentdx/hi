# Brent Davis - intro

I like empowering people and businesses with tools to grow and have fun. I'm a proud new dad. When I was 8 one of my paintings traveled the world with Sotheby's, and in high school I won a screenwriting award. It's all been downhill from there.

**Some things I believe:**
- It's easier to try to raise the ceiling and build for 100 people than raise the floor and try to build for 1m people. But raising the floor is more legacy.
- It's much easier to work on things that are exciting to you
- It's important to do things fast. You learn more per unit time because you make contact with reality more frequently
- One week is 2% of the year so work with speed but don't hurry. No time for BS.
- Be aware of how lossy your communication is. Compression is sometimes an asset, but usually a liability.
- In many cases it's more accurate to model the world as 500 people than 8 billion
- We are often not even asking the right questions
- The goal is not to avoid mistakes; the goal is to achieve uncorrelated levels of excellence in some dimension

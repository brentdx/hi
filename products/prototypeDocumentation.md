**Market thesis:** 
After thousands of customer interviews, studying incumbent growth trajectories, market dynamics of affiliates and creator payment flows, it was clear that the Bettor acquisition market was slowing down considerably.

**Product thesis:**
NY Times Games has 10m paid customers. We believe there are 100m sports fans who do not bet because they do not want to lose money, but would enjoy games that accompany games (more intensive than fantasy sports). So free-to-play, free-to-win games that drive social conversation by bringing elements of gaming and less focus on the betting. Our plan was to test alternate monetization approaches: from forced video advertising to premium upsells of data, in-game advantages, and more.

**Product MVP:**

Having observed the success of PrizePicks Daily Fantasy and deconstructing their biggest days, we designed a product that centralized conversation around a few players each night to focus conversation on social media.

Please find a [prototype of the product](https://www.figma.com/proto/NfRZxkMMbDo5TUmQSenw77/betwise.club?page-id=1390%3A1477&node-id=1416-6566&starting-point-node-id=1416%3A6566&t=MEspS0Q5g5U8JZDU-1). We were pivoting to, and a screenshot below for the lazy (no judgement).
